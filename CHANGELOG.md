- [0.2.2](#022)

</Details>

## 0.2.3

### Info

**This update is save safe. Ignore the popup about missing plugins.**

Bugfixes, balance tweaks, mod updates and minor additions.

Tweaked xp gains from various sources. Mostly buffs to xp gains.

Fixed level caps for skills not working. (you will **not** lose progress if your skill level is above the current cap on existing saves)

Made MCO draugr (Awoken Draugr) properly use Requiem draugr resistances & weaknesses. Attempted to tweak their stats closer to basic draugr, but more testing is needed.

Added Potion of Absolution, purchauseable from priests, which resets murder, stolen items and lifetime bounty stats. Useful only when you've been locked out of using a blessing.

 - Refer to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/khix4egd/Revenant-bug-reports) to track which are fixed and which still persist.

## 0.2.2

### Info

**This update is save safe. Ignore the popup about missing plugins. Please save in an *interior* before updating.**

Fixed the sleeping death bug. 

Overhauled a lot of NPC outfits thanks to Aljo (Some NPCs may still use old outfits on existing saves)

Fixed Concentrate Dead spell heal not working

Removed an old tweak from Vagabond that had slipped under my radar. In practice this means that NPC power attacks deal more damage but consume more stamina.

Removed ability to do melee attacks while in first person, to remove ability to cheese certain engagements which are easier on first than third person.

Removed the ability to toggle off survival mode in settings as this list is intended to be played with survival mode and I feel like giving an option to turn it off may bait people to disable it at earliest inconvenience.

 - Refer to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/khix4egd/Revenant-bug-reports) to track which are fixed and which still persist.
